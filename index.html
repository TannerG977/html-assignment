        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is <em>Tanner Douglas Green</em>. I was born July 11<sup>th</sup>, 2001 in Ottawa Ontario. I went to highschool at <abbr title="Notre Dame Catholic Highschool">NDCHS</abbr> in Carleton Place and graduated in 2019. I went to Algonquin College in 2020 and took the Powerline Technician course and decided it wasn't for me. I am now thoroughly enjoying the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin and am excited to learn.</p>
        <p>One of my favourite hobbies is playing and making music. Ive been playing guitar for 13 years and recently took up bass and keyboard. I also dabble with mixing music on my laptop using FL studio and a microphone I picked up. I'm not very knowledgeable at mixing music yet but I love learning and watching youtube videos about it.</p>
